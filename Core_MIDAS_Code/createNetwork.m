%createNetwork creates a network among agents living in different locations

%returns a sparse matrix network of all connected agents, with (i,j) ==1
%indicating that agents with IDs i and j are connected

%returns the distance matrix between all city centers in the map


%%%%%%%%%%

%we use a sparse matrix for agents where the i or j index corresponds to
%the agent's ID.  A '1' indicates a connection between agents i and j; the
%diagonal is all ones by default

%in this function the likelihood of an agent in city k having a connection
%to an agent in city m is proportional to the euclidean distance between
%the cities.  This particular function uses the shape of the normal
%distribution.  We order cities by their ID, construct a distance matrix,
%and then draw from a normal pdf to get the 'weighting' applied to each
%entry; their own city will have the highest density, thus highest
%weighting.

%numbers with actual agent lists, for speed.  this works only now because
